# Bee card clone
build your own Bee card !
Works only with the official Bee Pack from Hudson soft !!
For personnal use only


## Introduction:
Because there are only a few games available for this Bee Pack cartridge I decided to release a DIY card so you can put your own programmes on it, up to a maximum of 16 KB.
You will need an EPROM programmer.
You need to buy some 27c256 EPROM, nothing else. 

* To program a 16k game, please duplicate your file to make it 32k (2x 16k).
* To program a 8KB game on it, you need to duplicate it x4 times to make a 32KB file (4x8k)

> [!WARNING]
> I haven't managed to get a 32KB game to work!
> Before soldering the ROM to the backside, it is recommended that you make PCB for testint each Eprom.
> To solder correctly, it is recommended that you cut the pin before


## Revision 1.2 Board

To edit the PCB, use the standard setting like this:

* PCP Thickness =1.6mm
* PCB white, silkscreen black
* surface finish: ENIG
